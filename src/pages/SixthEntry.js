        I think it's over. The fifth one was offered at the power lines. With this, the Thousand-Day Promise should hold...<br/>
        I fear, however, that this one may bring unforeseen problems. They were children, certainly, but this last one...<br/>
        The Beast's arrival last year has put the court on edge... perhaps it's time I make my move. His name shouldn't be pronounced...

        My knowledge of the customs and of the Bulwark itself seems to have attracted the favor of Autumn. Benjamin doesn't seem to have <br/>
        noticed my actions towards the Promise, and it's best it remained that way... he does refuse to speak to me most of the time however...<br/>
        I truly hope my writing is still good enough. I disappointed Him once before.

        The Promise has held! We shouldn't see a whole lot of turmoil for the next 3 years or so. The sacrifice is... sadly worth it.<br/>
        And if they find out, they'll understand. There's nothing stronger to keep other children safe... just thinking about it<br/>
        does make me feel sick... that mask will haunt me for months. He was only 13...

        My memories are failing me. I can't remember the faces of the children affected. I know the effects are still active, as my<br/>
        nightmares are still very present, but I can't remember. My dreams have this new thing now, a female voice humming<br/>
        "La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la" in a sing-songy way... I don't recognize the voice, but... I feel like I should...

        Milio's appearance completely changed from one day to the next. He doesn't recall anything changing, and says he's always looked<br/>
        the same. Even pictures of him on my phone changed to his new appearance. What's going on? I need to go talk to... ugh... him again.<br/>
        He'll know about this, he's a pro at mirrors, and it looks like a use of Chrysalis.

        6 weeks of research with the grossest guy in the world. At least we got results, Milio's appearance has been affected by contracts<br/>
        of Reflection. By whom, or why, no one knows, but it's likely his appearance got overwritten by someone's reflection, or something close<br/>
        to it.
