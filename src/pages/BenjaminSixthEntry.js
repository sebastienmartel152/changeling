    <h3>Entry - May 4th 2013 (according to the Mortal Realm)</h3>
    <p>
        Well, since they're so fond of these journal-style entries, why not... The experiments on fragmentation and recovery are going smoothly.
        However, there's something we both don't quite grasp. While we do understand that the initial experiments went gently, given we've given
        the subjects fully safe passage to our domain, it would seem that the mere passage from the Mortal Realm to Arcadia exerta a toll on 
        travelers. That barrier seems to remove something from mortals, which we have yet to understand. A repurposing of my Prop to contain subjects
        may be an idea. Perhaps then, their travel will be made safer.

        My devotion to their cause is without question. However... progress seems slow. Our guest has stayed here for... over 3 years now. While it's
        mostly meaningless to us, and they claim their comfort is more than adequate, I can't help but think nothing will be achieved unless we understand
        this "soul" part of the Mortal essence. Without that key understanding, aiding these "Changelings" to reunite with their artificial part
        most likely won't be possible. What a "soul" is... is beyond me. Why do they need it? Why does the Hedge inevitably tear it?
    </p>

    <h3>Entry - January 3rd 2014 (according to the Mortal Realm)</h3>
    <p>
        Yesterday (I'm still getting used to this tracking of time), we've successfully found a way to use my Ice to contain objects safely, and encase
        them. Unfortunately, even in that containment, objects are denatured by their passage through the Hedge. It'll make for a fine snack, I'm sure.
        Hopefully they like it too.
    </p>

        So it is most definitely a more-than-adequate food. These "apples" (according to our guest) don't come in a blue variety, but according to my
        better part, they're absolutely delicious. I wish I could sustain on something other than meat and appreciate sweet foods, but I'll still make
        sure to grow these. They say it's their favorite, and they have this "gardening" book from the mortal Realm. Why not just use Glamour to grow 
        these...? But since they insist... hopefully they go well with their other favorite. 
    </p>

    <h3>Entry - July 11th 2014 (according to the Mortal Realm)</h3>
    <p>
        I... am growing fond of them. Not in the typical, dance-like, court-like way, but... genuinely. According to our guest, this is related to the
        soul. How would love be related to having a soul? I have felt it before. Though I presume... not in quite this way. Journal, do you believe they
        feel the same? Have they felt it as well? It's not an unpleasant feeling. Regardless, today's another large experiment day. While fetches typically
        require part of the original to exist and hold, my better part believes there's another way: willingness. Hopefully our guest agrees.
    </p>

    <h3>Entry - July 13th 2014 (according to the Mortal Realm)</h3>
    <p>
        The process seems to have worked! They're getting me invested in this. This is progress! Now, what we need is a way to create the opposite process.
        Safely reuniting a Fetch with their mortal counterpart is still a ways away, but at least we're finding things. Still a bizarre idea to me, but they
        seem adamant on succeeding. Weird name for our guest to take, considering how delicate the process is, but it's their call, really.
