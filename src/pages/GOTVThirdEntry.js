        On Writing Workshops -

        This is fascinating. These "loops" are, rather than a temporal phenomenon, a literal rewriting of the story at a level of existence far higher than ours. Someone has
        developed the ability to act upon our reality as if it were a writing workshop (going forward, the word Workshop will refer to these), allowing them to treat real events
        as if they were passages written in a book, and tearing off pages to rewrite them. This ability seems limited in range and scope, but allows them to tear out passages
        of reality, and rewrite initial conditions. This process must require a tremendous amount of Mana or other energy.

        These are presumptions, but the story must still make sense in order to be rewritten. For example, it is likely that named, existing characters must remain in the story.
        It is unlikely that the "book" itself can be torn apart and started from a blank page. More notes to follow, but the intel our client has provided is simply amazing! We'll
        begin applications of this process immediately!
