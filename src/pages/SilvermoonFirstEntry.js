    <ul>Yes ma'am. Contingencies are in place. Do know you'll be limited to twelve per workshop.</ul>        
    <ul>Yes ma'am. 8 seconds per stop. Retroactive up to 5 minutes.</ul>        
    <ul>Yes, I understand.</ul>        
    <ul>Yes ma'am, I understand. As per our agreement and understanding, you will provide your own methods of scrying.</ul>        
    <ul>Ma'am, twelve is a massive amount. Anything further may cause undesired results, for us and yourself.</ul>        
    <ul>Yes ma'am, we've been looking into it. Results are inconclusive.</ul>        
    <ul>Yes, they are fixed points. It's only a matter of time before they notice.</ul>        
    <ul>The Storyteller, ma'am.</ul>        
    <ul>Yes, ma'am, I know, but his effects are real nonetheless.</ul>        
    <ul>...I don't know that, ma'am.</ul>        
    <ul>Hmm. We can look into this, but the Dawn Court has significant resources, and their Monarch is--</ul>        
    <ul>*sighs* Yes, ma'am. We'll look into connections. Your contributions are appreciated.</ul>        
    <ul>Oh, of course ma'am. As long as it keeps going, we'll aid in that endeavor.</ul>        
    <ul>I can assure you she is unaware of it, ma'am.</ul>        
    <ul>...I can assure you she is unaware of it, ma'am.</ul>        
    <ul>Understood.</ul>        
    <ul>...oh. If you're offering shared knowledge of this, we can certainly alter the conditions of our contract.</ul>        
    <ul>Of course, ma'am. We'll help you find them. Reality editing is something we could benefit from.</ul>        
    <ul>*chuckles* Yes, ma'am, I understand. Redaction has a good note to it. Simply using the terms of my trade.</ul>
    <ul>Of course. Good evening, miss Archambault. Silvermoon Estates appreciates your continued patronage.</ul>
