    <p>
        Well, since they're so fond of these journal-style entries, why not... The experiments on fragmentation and recovery are going smoothly.
        However, there's something we both don't quite grasp. While we do understand that the initial experiments went gently, given we've given
        the subjects fully safe passage to our domain, it would seem that the mere passage from the Mortal Realm to Arcadia exerta a toll on 
        travelers. That barrier seems to remove something from mortals, which we have yet to understand. A repurposing of my Prop to contain subjects
        may be an idea. Perhaps then, their travel will be made safer.
