    <h3>Entry - May 4th 2013 (according to the Mortal Realm)</h3>
    <p>
        Well, since they're so fond of these journal-style entries, why not... The experiments on fragmentation and recovery are going smoothly.
        However, there's something we both don't quite grasp. While we do understand that the initial experiments went gently, given we've given
        the subjects fully safe passage to our domain, it would seem that the mere passage from the Mortal Realm to Arcadia exerta a toll on 
        travelers. That barrier seems to remove something from mortals, which we have yet to understand. A repurposing of my Prop to contain subjects
        may be an idea. Perhaps then, their travel will be made safer.
    </p>

        My devotion to their cause is without question. However... progress seems slow. Our guest has stayed here for... over 3 years now. While it's
        mostly meaningless to us, and they claim their comfort is more than adequate, I can't help but think nothing will be achieved unless we understand
        this "soul" part of the Mortal essence. Without that key understanding, aiding these "Changelings" to reunite with their artificial part
        most likely won't be possible. What a "soul" is... is beyond me. Why do they need it? Why does the Hedge inevitably tear it?
    </p>

    <h3>Entry - January 3rd 2014 (according to the Mortal Realm)</h3>
    <p>
        Yesterday (I'm still getting used to this tracking of time), we've successfully found a way to use my Ice to contain objects safely, and encase
        them. Unfortunately, even in that containment, objects are denatured by their passage through the Hedge. It'll make for a fine snack, I'm sure.
        Hopefully they like it too.
    </p>

        So it is most definitely a more-than-adequate food. These "apples" (according to our guest) don't come in a blue variety, but according to my
        better part, they're absolutely delicious. I wish I could sustain on something other than meat and appreciate sweet foods, but I'll still make
        sure to grow these. They say it's their favorite, and they have this "gardening" book from the mortal Realm. Why not just use Glamour to grow 
        these...? But since they insist... hopefully they go well with their other favorite. 
    </p>

    <h3>Entry - July 11th 2014 (according to the Mortal Realm)</h3>
    <p>
        I... am growing fond of them. Not in the typical, dance-like, court-like way, but... genuinely. According to our guest, this is related to the
        soul. How would love be related to having a soul? I have felt it before. Though I presume... not in quite this way. Journal, do you believe they
        feel the same? Have they felt it as well? It's not an unpleasant feeling. Regardless, today's another large experiment day. While fetches typically
        require part of the original to exist and hold, my better part believes there's another way: willingness. Hopefully our guest agrees.
    </p>

    <h3>Entry - July 13th 2014 (according to the Mortal Realm)</h3>
    <p>
        The process seems to have worked! They're getting me invested in this. This is progress! Now, what we need is a way to create the opposite process.
        Safely reuniting a Fetch with their mortal counterpart is still a ways away, but at least we're finding things. Still a bizarre idea to me, but they
        seem adamant on succeeding. Weird name for our guest to take, considering how delicate the process is, but it's their call, really.
    </p>

    <h3>Entry - February 6th 2015 (according to the Mortal Realm)</h3>
    <p>
        With Gristle's help, we figured it out. My Ice can let the Wyrd's nature-changing effects through, but it won't let anything out. Therefore, it
        could potentially contain a soul. Moreover, it seems to be movement within the Hedge that causes this change, not simply existing there. I have
        sent Ice-Touched creatures to hunt for fragments of souls within the Hedge. If all goes well, the moment they bite into it, it'll be conteined
        within the Ice.
    </p>

    <h3>Entry - May 12th 2015 (according to the Mortal Realm)</h3>
    <p>
        It worked. And funnily enough, it would seem that this phrase I've been using, "my better part", is a mark of affection. And yes, they have
        reciprocated the same feelings. It's an interesting thing to go through. Our mortal Realm contact has agreed to negotiate for our temporary presence
        within the mortal Realm, so we can finally test if our efforts will work. 
    </p>

    <h3>Entry - June 20th 2015 (according to the Mortal Realm)</h3>
    <p>
        Containing a mortal within Ice, then transporting them through the Hedge, fully safeguards them. Their soul seems to remain intact. This is
        excellent! If we can find a method that doesn't involve encasing them fully in Ice, then the experiment will be a perfect success. This will
        prevent mortals from having their souls torn apart when pulled into the Hedge, and in doing so, mending a Fetch's soul fragment to its original
        will be a simple matter. 

        I believe that repurposing this barrier the Changelings are using, to shelter any mortal souls passing through, is the best way
        to go.
    </p>

    <h3>Entry - October 15th 2015 (according to the Mortal Realm)</h3>
    <p>
        Quill fell in love with Gristle. I... fell in a rage, and in so doing, severely damaged things, including Francis' emotions, Gristle's original.
        We have been looking for Francis for several days. It's my fault. Fae isn't meant to be in such complacent control! But... I can't bring myself to
        hurt Quill. Or Gristle. I... love them too much for this. 

        Quill wishes to undergo a few more experiments, and I'll follow them through, of course. Quill believes that in order to help the mortal Realm,
        they need to approach them more fully. But... why? Why not simply send Gristle on their way, and stay here with me? This process takes well over 2
        years, why are they so passionate about this, why do they GET so passionate about everything?! Maybe that's what I fell in love with from the get go.

        I'm sorry, Quill. I'm done with these journal entries. The pages are too wet now anyway.
